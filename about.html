             <h1>About Me</h1>
             <p>    Hi, I'm Nur Nabilah Natasha, I'm currently a student in Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, Terengganu,<br> 
                 Malaysia. I have a big interest in technology especially in Artificial Intelligence. For the time <br>
                 being, my main focus is on Website Development since my computer science major is Internet Computing. <br>
                 Aside from that, I usually code simple games for fun and to build my coding skills. I've learnt many <br>
                 programming languages including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and C++.<br>
                 <br>
                    In the future, I would love to learn more about latest technology especially in Artificial Intelligence.  <br> 
                 My biggest dream is to become an Artificial Intelligence developer where I can help the people with it.  <br>
                 Apart from it, I also have a personal Instagram page where I dedicated it for my another interest which <br>
                 is Photography. I have interest in taking pictures of natures and architecture.
